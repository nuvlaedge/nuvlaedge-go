# NuvlaEdge configuration file
#
#
# This file contains the configuration options for NuvlaEdge. The configuration file is in TOML format.
# The indentation in this file is for readability only. It is not required.
#
#
# This file can be loaded into NuvlaEdge using the `--config` flag or by placing it in the default location
# `/etc/nuvlaedge/config.toml`. The default location can be overridden by setting the `NUVLAEDGE_CONFIG` environment variable.
#
# The priority of the configuration options is as follows:
# 1. Default values
# 2. Configuration file
# 3. Environment variables
# 4. Command line flags
# Meaning if an option is set in the configuration file, it will override the default value, but can be overridden by an environment variable or a command line flag.
#
# In the first run of the NuvlaEdge, there is a single compulsory field in the configuration pipeline, NuvlaEdge UUID.
# This can be set in the configuration file, environment variable or command line flag.
# In the subsequent runs, the NuvlaEdge UUID and the required configuration are stored in a freeze file which then can
# be used to start NuvlaEdge without the need to provide the UUID and the configuration.
